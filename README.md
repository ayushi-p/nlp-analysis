Russia’s invasion on Ukraine started in February 2022 and has been the biggest threat to international peace and security in the 21st century. This consultant report uses public opinion expressed via social media including Twitter and Reddit to gain insights into the war to better assist the Ukraine government and NGOs in modifying its campaign strategy and coverage to receive support from a wider international audience. I have attempted to do so by applying sentiment analysis on a few biased and unbiased social media datasets spanning the period of the conflict. A model for Natural Language Processing Sentiment Analysis created for this purpose is also compared against pre-existing Python libraries to test its performance. Several key sentiment drivers were identified based on the analysis of extreme sentiments, both negative and positive, to get a clear idea of how Ukraine is viewed in light of this invasion and recommendations are made to the government and international NGOs about steps that will positively impact Ukraine’s international presence and image.
